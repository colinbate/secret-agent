# Welcome to Secret Agent

This is meant to be an online multi-player version of the 1984 German boardgame, Heimlich & Co.

Once up and running, I'll try to keep an official version running, but I wanted to make it available for others to run on their own. You will need node.js to run the server and therefore the game locally.
